# Abstract
The abstract introduces "coded computing," a novel approach that employs coding theory to enhance large-scale distributed computing. It addresses communication, straggler delays, privacy, and security issues. Key contributions include:

1. **Coded Distributed Computing (CDC):** Reduces communication load in MapReduce-based systems, achieving optimal computation-communication balance.

2. **Straggler Mitigation:** Introduces "Polynomial Codes" and "Lagrange Coded Computing" to minimize computation latency by distributing redundant data/computation across nodes.

3. **Security and Privacy:** Extends LCC for robust security and privacy with minimal coding overhead.

4. **Real-World Impact:** Implements coded computing in cloud-based systems, significantly improving performance in tasks like sorting and regression model training.

In short, coded computing optimizes distributed computing by leveraging coding theory to address various challenges effectively.
